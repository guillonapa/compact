## What is `compact.io`

Image optimizer and compression software: a library to do two things, perhaps one after the other, optimize (or reduce the size) of an image depending what the image is intended for (print, web, phone), and compress the image using a set of values (maybe pixels) to represent the values of a set of pixels (grid) that have been previously computer and stored in memory or disk. The libraries should be in GoLang for learning purposes.
